Being a 23-year-old musician From New Orleans I have obtained an obsession with art
& design, Making something out of nothing & knowing it will Last forever is why I do
What I do. I've fallen in love with the process of structuring a Song, 
from designing the cover art, through the sleepless nights in the studio, 
and all the way to release day. It is quite literally my drug..  Besides 
my passion for making music, the city I grew up in showed me no one gets 
a shot unless a shot is taken and with talent crawling everywhere you see
sometimes people just need someone to believe in them and put them in range
of the shot we all so badly want, and I feel it’s time Louisiana shows the 
world the energy that we keep bottled up!! I want to change life’s of people
in all aspects just as music has changed mine. With my record label, development team,
and the artist surrounding me... I hope you are ready for the south!!
